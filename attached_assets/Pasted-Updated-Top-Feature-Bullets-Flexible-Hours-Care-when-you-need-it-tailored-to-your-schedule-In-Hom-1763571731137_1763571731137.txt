New to In-Home Care?

Choosing home care for a loved one can feel overwhelming — but Home Sweet Home Care makes the process simple, clear, and stress-free. We guide you every step of the way with compassion, clarity, and flexibility.

Learn how easy it is to Get Started With Professional Home Care, and discover how our tailored support promotes comfort, safety, and peace of mind at home.

✅ How to Get Started With Home Sweet Home Care
01 — Schedule Your Free In-Home Consultation

A Home Sweet Home Care coordinator will visit your home (or meet by phone/Zoom) to learn about your loved one’s needs, daily routines, health considerations, and preferences.
We’ll answer all your questions and explain the best care options for your family.

02 — Receive a Customized Care Plan

If you decide to move forward, we’ll complete a full in-home assessment — including a safety, fall-risk, and home-environment review.
From there, we create a personalized care plan and recommended schedule based on your goals, lifestyle, and budget.

03 — Meet Your Caregiver

We match your loved one with a professional W-2 caregiver who has passed Level-2 background screening and aligns with your preferences.
You’ll always know who is coming into the home, and you’ll feel confident knowing your loved one is safe, supported, and cared for with dignity.
